# âœ… Unit Testing in C# using NUnit â€“ Calculator Test Project

This project demonstrates basic **Unit Testing** using **NUnit** in C#.  
The focus is on testing core calculator operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- âœ… **Explain the meaning of Unit Testing and difference from Functional Testing**
  - Unit Testing: Tests the **smallest unit** of code (e.g., a method)
  - Functional Testing: Tests the **end-to-end flow or feature**
  - Unit tests often **mock dependencies** to isolate the unit

- âœ… **List various types of testing**
  - Unit Testing
  - Functional Testing
  - Automated Testing
  - Performance Testing

- âœ… **Understand the benefit of Automated Testing**
  - Saves time
  - Improves code reliability
  - Reduces manual errors
  - Enables faster development feedback

- âœ… **Explain loosely coupled & testable design**
  - Code should **not be tightly dependent** on concrete classes
  - Use **interfaces and dependency injection** to improve testability

- âœ… **Write your first test program**
  - Validated `Addition` using:
    - `[TestFixture]`
    - `[Test]`
    - `[TestCase]`

- âœ… **Understand key NUnit attributes**
  - `[SetUp]`: Runs before each test
  - `[TearDown]`: Runs after each test
  - `[Ignore]`: Skips a test with a reason

- âœ… **Explain the benefit of parameterized test cases**
  - Test different input/output combinations with a single method
  - Keeps code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Easily scalable

## âœ… Sample Test Example

```csharp
[Test]
[TestCase(2, 3, 5)]
[TestCase(-1, -1, -2)]
public void Addition_ReturnsExpected(double a, double b, double expected)
{
    var result = _calculator.Addition(a, b);
    Assert.That(result, Is.EqualTo(expected));
}
